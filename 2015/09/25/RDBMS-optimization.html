  <article class="post-content">
    
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system" target="_blank">RDBMS</a> is a concept which is about sophisticated data store. Everything here is about relations, you can even define the level of security by defining constraints for particular data tables. However, everything has its own price (CPU in this case) and this is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL" target="_blank">NoSQL</a> wins. Looking from the security perspective, RDBMS is the right tool for finance, banking business as it supports transactions with locking I/O while a transaction is in process. Anyway, this blog post is about optimization of RDBMS when it comes to input.</p>
<h2>Current tools</h2>

<p>There are a lot of RDBMS based software, you can check it out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_relational_database_management_systems" target="_blank">here</a>. The most popular ones are <a href="https://www.mysql.com" target="_blank">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> in open source community. The issue with all of these is the variaty of supported methods of input. Well ok, using bash you can easily export/import, but when it comes to application level usage, this is getting fuzzier. Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>
  I like PostgreSQL which has <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-prepare.html" target="_blank">Prepared Statements</a> function. Although everyone usually use default SQL queries to reach the data, it's not efficient. For prototypes it works, but not for production applications. So if you're using any RDBMS software, please be aware of I/O optimization when it's needed.
</p>
<h2>Prepared Statements</h2>

<p>PostgeSQL supports a lot of ways to input your data to a database. COPY, INSERT, Bash interface etc. Well, about 5 years ago, I’ve been searching for a proper way to input updated data to my database and the requirement was to make it as efficient as possible for high load. This is where Prepared Statements comes into the play.</p>
<p>
  The principle is simple: by using Prepared Statements you create a framework of all the dependencies for the query and when you call the query, it just use the cached framework with your sent data. This is like a trade-off between your resources: you pay more memory and save CPU.
</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>In Ruby it’s simple if you use <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net" target="_blank">Sequel</a>. At that time, I used the newest version of it, now it’s a bit outdated, but I’m sure they have similar interface for this function in the newest version. <a href="https://gist.github.com/kurbaitis/f5387059177c13768a1a">The example</a>:</p>
<h2>Sum up</h2>
<p>Actually, I’ve created an extension for Sequel for automated prepared statements creation, so it’s possible just to make it work by default in Sequel. Hopefully, one day I’ll release it, but for now I’m more focused to my experiment. Happy investigation!</p>
