    This post is for those who work using SOA or other kind of distributed architecture.
    The biggest challenge for developers when working with this kind of architecture is to make development process as easy as possible. To achieve this goal there are a lot of tools but in this post I'll show how to do that with [Tmux][t] and [Tmuxinator][tr]. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Requirements: `Mac OSX (~> 10.10.3), Brew (~> 0.9.5), Ruby (~> 2.2.2)`
    <br />
    Install Tmux: `brew install tmux`
    <br />
    Install Tmuxinator: `gem install tmuxinator`
    <br />
    Create tmuxinator project: [gist][g1]
    <br />
    Connect bash to tmux: download tmuxinator.bash [here][tb] and put it in `~/.bin` directory.
    <br />
    Add this to your `~/.bash_profile`: `source ~/.bin/tmuxinator.bash`
    <br />
    Run your project: `mux project_name`
    <br />
    <br />
    Now you have all your setup accessible via one bash command.
