    This post is for those who work using SOA or other kind of distributed architecture.
    The biggest challenge for developers when working with this kind of architecture is to make development process as easy as possible. To achieve this goal there are a lot of tools but in this post I'll show how to do that with [Tmux][t] and [Tmuxinator][tr]. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Requirements: `Mac OSX (~> 10.10.3), Brew (~> 0.9.5), Ruby (~> 2.2.2)`
    <br />
    <br />
    Install Tmux: `brew install tmux`
    <br />
    <br />
    Install Tmuxinator: `gem install tmuxinator`
    <br />
    <br />
    Create tmuxinator project: [gist][g1]
     # ~/.tmuxinator/project_name.yml
    
     name: project_name
     root: ~/Sites/your-services-root-dir
    
     # Optional tmux socket
     # socket_name: foo
    
     # Runs before everything. Use it to start daemons etc.
     pre: cd ~/ && nohup ./bin/redis >/dev/null 2>&1 &
    
     # Runs in each window and pane before window/pane specific commands. Useful for setting up interpreter versions.
     pre_window: rbenv local 2.2.2
    
     # Pass command line options to tmux. Useful for specifying a different tmux.conf.
     # tmux_options: -f ~/.tmux.mac.conf
    
     # Change the command to call tmux.  This can be used by derivatives/wrappers like byobu.
     # tmux_command: byobu
    
     # Specifies (by name or index) which window will be selected on project startup. If not set, the first window is used.
     # startup_window: logs
     # tmux kill-session -t
     # Controls whether the tmux session should be attached to automatically. Defaults to true.
     # attach: false
    
     # Runs after everything. Use it to attach to tmux with custom options etc.
     # post: tmux -CC attach -t project_name
    
     # Start a new window for each project service
     windows:
       - service1: cd service1 && be foreman start
       - service2: cd service2 && be foreman start
       - service3: cd service3 && be foreman start
