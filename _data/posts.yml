    This post is for those who work using SOA or other kind of distributed architecture.
    The biggest challenge for developers when working with this kind of architecture is to make development process as easy as possible. To achieve this goal there are a lot of tools but in this post I will show how to do that with [Tmux][t] and [Tmuxinator][tr]. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Requirements: `Mac OSX (~> 10.10.3), Brew (~> 0.9.5), Ruby (~> 2.2.2)`
    <br />
    Install Tmux: `brew install tmux`
    <br />
    Install Tmuxinator: `gem install tmuxinator`
    <br />
    Create tmuxinator project: [gist][g1]
    <br />
    Connect bash to tmux: download tmuxinator.bash [here][tb] and put it in `~/.bin` directory.
    <br />
    Add this to your `~/.bash_profile`: `source ~/.bin/tmuxinator.bash`
    <br />
    Run your project: `mux project_name`
    <br />
    <br />
    Now you have all your setup accessible via one bash command.

      To be honest, last time I worked on a project based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) was a few years ago, but I think it's a good idea to share my 
      experience with it. There are a lot of advantages of SOA but for me these three are the most important: scaling, speed and decoupling.
    </p>
    <h2>Scaling</h2>
    <p>
       Scaling comes into play when your traffic grows. If you have monolithic application you can scale all of it independently of the parts that have high traffic.
       But this way is not efficient as unused parts of the project will eat your resources while scaling.
    </p>
    <p>SOA helps to scale only the needed parts of your project and keep the system efficient.</p>
    <h2>Speed</h2>
    <p>
       Small modular resources, optimized for particular role in a system, helps to achieve speed of accessing that resources and creates value by saving your customers 
       time. You need statistics? Create a service on top of MongoDB. Need to work with bank transactions? Create a service on top of RDBMS.</p>
    <h2>Decoupling</h2>
    <p>
       In general, decoupling is a good practice at any level of development. No one wants to work in a mess. It also serves very well when it comes to distributed 
       teams as you can control access of your services and divide development work to external teams without worrying that someone access not permitted data or code.

    From the first days of my career as a programmer, I was using sophisticated and heavy tools for writing code. Actually, the first editor I tried was 
    [Adobe Dreamweaver][ad]. It's still alive and does its job quite well I suppose. Later on [TextMate][tm] which is one of my favorites code writing tools.
    A few months ago I tried [Atom][a] which is pretty nice too and comes with not so laggy text search as TextMate's.
    But this post is important not because of this story but because I've found a setup that makes me happy.
    
    <h2>Operating System</h2>
    <p>Let's be honest, the majority of medium experienced web developers like Mac OS X. I like it too. It's simple, beautiful for eye and is Unix family member.</p>
    <h2>Editor</h2>
    <p>Like mentioned in the intro, editor is the key for hapiness.</p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I catch myself thinking that web developer is a weak programmer. It's like a challenge and honor thing for each programmer to do as much cool stuff 
      as possible. However, I believe that there is a trade-off between cool stuff and the value you're really creating. To make it clear: not always cool stuff 
      creates more value.
    </p>
    But this post is about fun. Fun is to do something cool. Cool is something simple and easy. If you're a developer, probably you'd agree that the simpliest but 
    maybe not easiest editor is [Vim][v].
    When using Vim you use only keyboard to write, navigate and do other cool stuff. No mouse or trackpad clicking, just pure sound of your keyboard.
    As I'm a Ruby developer, [here's][s] the setup of Vim for rubyists on Mac OS X.
    
    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    Sometimes developers tend to overcomplicate things. This is why I like Ruby, although, it has it's own drawbacks too. Anyway, while writing any kind of code,
    it is important how do you manage your codebase and navigate across files while working.

    <p>Someone would say, just install some plugins to Vim and forget it. But this is not so efficient. Sounds weird but that's my opinion.</p>
    <p>If you need to switch among files a lot of times while working, that means that you're not following TDD/BDD and doing things with inertia, hurrying.</p>
    Good code takes time to write and think. Good naming helps to save time while connecting various bits of code and if you do this correctly, this kind of coding 
    starts to make sense.
    For code versioning I use [Git][g], editor - Vim, for file previewing, in case you need quickly look at some other than current Vim opened file - [Highlight][h]. 
    All these components are in separate Terminal tabs to make easier to navigate among those.
    
    <h2>Highlight</h2>
    <p>Sometimes while working on complicated part of application you need to view other files quickly. For this purpose I use Highlight.</p>

    Install Highlight: `brew install highlight`
    <br />
    Add alias to your `~/.bash_profile`: `alias c='highlight -O ansi -l'`
    <br />
    Usage: `c path/to/filename`

    <h2>Sum up</h2>
    <p>Although this works for me and helps to follow TDD/BDD practices, every developer has his/her own preferences. Happy coding!</p>

    After installing [Tmux][t] I felt a bit confused. There is just plain "man" style documentation. I like things simple and explained clearly for a tool that is used by someone for the first time. Well that's not a big deal, I just needed to get deeper into the text and here is what I've found.
    
    <h2>Commands</h2>
    
    The first thing which was not clear to me was the switching among windows. To make that happen you need to use commands. Actually, that was not working at the beginning as I was missing `~./bin/tmuxinator.bash` file. Anyway, after some time I managed to figure out how to enter commands, switch among windows, split windows etc. To enter a command you need to use `Ctrl + b` and enter the command's character. [Here][h] is the list of commands.
    
    <h2>Sum up</h2>
    
    A bit pitty that there is no straight shortcuts like in Vim, but Tmux is still a handy tool for making things easier.

    When working with Ruby together with team on a project, everyone should follow the same code standards to avoid mess and achieve better development speed. Usually, Ruby developers follow common rules and try to avoid rare operators, expressions and so on. But sometimes it's fun to play, explore and use variuos exotic Ruby capabilities to make development more interesting. 
    
    <h2>Standards</h2>
    
    <p>
      Usually, standards are pretty simple when it comes to editor configuration. 2 space soft tabs, tidy indentation and new line at the end of a file.
    </p>
      Proper code styling is a bit more sophisticated part. There are a lot of style guides that could be used by companies but I choose [Thoughbot][t] which is quite nice. If needed, of course, it can be adjusted by forking the repo.
    
    <p>
      Although it's good to follow standards, Ruby has a lot of power for fun.
    </p>

    <h2>Operators</h2>
   
    <p>
      If you're reading this blog, you should understand what are operators about and how to use them. Ruby has a lot of operators that can work independently among variuos kind of objects but in this blog post I'll mention just some interesting operators and use cases that could be used to have fun.
    </p> 

    <h3>*</h3>
    [Array#join][j] is a method for joining elements (String) to a row separated by the given argument. Example of usage:
    <br /><br /> 
    ```
    irb(main):001:0> ['a', 'b', 'c'].join(',')
    ```
    <br />
    ```
    => "a,b,c"
    ```
 
    <p>
      Shortcut <strong>*</strong> makes the syntax more fun:
    </p>
    ```
    irb(main):002:0> ['a', 'b', 'c'] * ','
    ```
    <br />
    ```=> "a,b,c"
    ```

    <h3>%</h3>
    [Numeric#modulo][m] is a math function which is very useful for arrays iterations when needed to insert something periodically into output.
    <br />
    Example:
    <br /> 
    ```irb(main):001:0> 22.modulo(10)```
    <br />
    ```=> 2```
   
    <p>
      Shortcut:
    </p>
    
    ```irb(main):002:0> 22 % 10```
    <br /> 
    ```=> 2```

    When starting to build a SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) project, sometimes it's hard to choose the right tools for it. 
    My first SOA project where I had a chance to participate was started a few years ago. 
    At that time there was no ready for production out-of-box solution for this kind of Ruby based systems. 
    Well, that was not a big problem for our team because we just builded the solution from scratch by ourselves.

    <h2>Blueprint</h2>

    The goal for our team was to create distributed, isolated and fast working architecture with capabilities for quick expansion. 
    It was needed to outsource some parts of the project for external teams, so the security was one of the main priorities.
    To achieve that, we needed to create something like [OAuth 1.0][o]. 
    It's a simple protocol which works very nicely when implementing together with concurrent requests for multiple resources fetching.
      
    <p>
     The schema below shows simplified version of the principle how it works.
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/img/soa-schema1.png" />

    <p>
      <strong>(1)</strong> - Before fetching resources (Service 1) must connect to Auth service and ask if it has permissions to operate on the Service 2.
      If it has, Auth provides authentication token to use for limited amount of time (30 mins etc) and, using that token <strong>(2)</strong>,
      Service 1 is able to connect to Service 2 and operate on the resources.
    </p> 

    <h2>Database structure</h2>
    The main architecture's structure is kept in Auth service as it decides about services communication security.
      
    <p>
     The fields in Auth <strong>clients</strong> table were these: <em>client_id, service_id, scope</em>.
     One more table was needed for the temporary access tokens, let's call it <strong>tokens</strong>: 
     <em>
       client_id (table's <strong>clients</strong> id), token, created_at
     </em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Client gem</h2>
       
    To make things faster and ease the communication among services including Auth gateway, we created a gem (not available as opensource anymore). 
    It includes caching of temporary tokens, concurrent HTTPS requests ([Typhoeus][t]) 
    and nice API for configuration of the services.

    <h2>Try yourself</h2>

    These days the situation is a bit different. I'm sure there are a lot of nice gems that could be combined together to achieve the same purpose.
    But before getting on this work, please read carefully about <a href="" target="_blank">[SOA][s]</a>
    and decide if it's a good choice for your project. Don't hesitate to use my proposed solution because it's pretty simple and you make sure that you know
    100% how your system works by doing the system from scratch.
