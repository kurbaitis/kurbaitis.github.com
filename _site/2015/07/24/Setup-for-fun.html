  <article class="post-content">
    
<p>From the first days of my career as a programmer, I was using sophisticated and heavy tools for writing code. Actually, the first editor I tried was  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Adobe Dreamweaver</a>. It’s still alive and does its job quite well I suppose. Later on <a href="https://macromates.com">TextMate</a> which is one of my favorites code writing tools. A few months ago I tried <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> which is pretty nice too and comes with not so laggy text search as TextMate’s. But this post is important not because of this story but because I’ve found a setup that makes me happy.</p>
<h2>Operating System</h2>
<p>Let's be honest, the majority of medium experienced web developers like Mac OS X. I like it too. It's simple, beautiful for eye and is Unix family member.</p>
<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>Like mentioned in the intro, editor is the key for hapiness.</p>
<p>
  Sometimes I catch myself thinking that web developer is a weak programmer. It's like a challenge and honor thing for each programmer to do as much cool stuff 
  as possible. However, I believe that there is a trade-off between cool stuff and the value you're really creating. To make it clear: not always cool stuff 
  creates more value.
</p>
<p>But this post is about fun. Fun is to do something cool. Cool is something simple and easy. If you’re a developer, probably you’d agree that the simpliest but  maybe not easiest editor is <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>. When using Vim you use only keyboard to write, navigate and do other cool stuff. No mouse or trackpad clicking, just pure sound of your keyboard. As I’m a Ruby developer, <a href="https://gist.github.com/e4b526dffc109ab5384c">here’s</a> the setup of Vim for rubyists on Mac OS X.</p>
<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>Sometimes developers tend to overcomplicate things. This is why I like Ruby, although, it has it’s own drawbacks too. Anyway, while writing any kind of code, it is important how do you manage your codebase and navigate across files while working.</p>
<p>Someone would say, just install some plugins to Vim and forget it. But this is not so efficient. Sounds weird but that's my opinion.</p>
<p>If you need to switch among files a lot of times while working, that means that you're not following TDD/BDD and doing things with inertia, hurrying.</p>
<p>Good code takes time to write and think. Good naming helps to save time while connecting various bits of code and if you do this correctly, this kind of coding  starts to make sense. For code versioning I use <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>, editor - Vim, for file previewing, in case you need quickly look at some other than current Vim opened file - <a href="http://www.andre-simon.de">Highlight</a>.  All these components are in separate Terminal tabs to make easier to navigate among those.</p>
<h2>Highlight</h2>
<p>Sometimes while working on complicated part of application you need to view other files quickly. For this purpose I use Highlight.</p>
<p>Install Highlight: <code>brew install highlight</code> <br /> Add alias to your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>: <code>alias c='highlight -O ansi -l'</code> <br /> Usage: <code>c path/to/filename</code></p>
<h2>Sum up</h2>
<p>Although this works for me and helps to follow TDD/BDD practices, every developer has his/her own preferences. Happy coding!</p>
