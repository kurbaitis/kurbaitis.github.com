  <article class="post-content">
    
<p>This blog post is about the simplicity of creating pure Ruby based websites. Actually, everything what you need for creating a website without connected 3rd parties is in default Ruby build source. WEBrick with ERB and CGI (legacy) support gives you a lot of power to build simple, easy to use and reliable websites (if you know how Ruby works and write code respectfully).</p>
<h2>The issue</h2>
<p>Like I’ve mentioned in earlier blog posts, the problem with website usability is simple: there are just too many stuff and options for a customer. If you do things right, you focus and provide services that are exactly for the segment which you’re targeting to. Less hassle, less pain for everyone.</p>
<p>
  If you follow this philosophy of single segment orientation, it's very easy to create a simple site for your products or other kind of value selling. It's harder to make all the necessary services (payments, monitoring, scaling) to work properly and neatly. This needs a bit more understanding in other concepts like encapsulation, decoupling, security and so on. While working on my experiment, I'm doing some thinking how to make things easier by removing some dependencies. This is where native Ruby libraries comes into play.
</p>
<h2>Sinatra</h2>
<p>Sinatra is a beautiful framework (a separate gem), but I’m not sure about its long term capabilities to manage traffic. Ruby is leaking memory if you create a lot of objects and do not use GC properly. If you want to write a beautiful Sinatra based application, you need to use a lot of objects and also it adds additional level to your application stack: Rack -&gt; WEBrick -&gt; Sinatra. Well, I don’t want to spare a lot of time for investigating that layers compatibility issues and GC. Better think something simplier and use local variables that are not so hard to manage for Ruby: this is what I’m doing in my experiment.</p>
<h2>My try</h2>

<p>The thing I’m trying currently is to use pure WEBrick server which is included by default in Ruby build source. Recently, I discovered that it supports mounting all needed routes directly to given templates. The variables (from 3rd party apps too) get forwarded from lib/ level and templates just print out the final views. The implementation <a href="https://gist.github.com/kurbaitis/c81e65a1f8b1b3e86405">files</a>.</p>
<p>
  The issue here is that you need to pass current variables scope (binding) to the lib/ level. Well, it's a bit pain if you don't want to create additional instances and use just functional programming. But maybe there is another way. 
</p>
<h2>Sum up</h2>
<p>
  So this post is about a bit different approach: logic in lib/, routing in app.rb and the templates in views/. No mixing anything and as much functional programming as possible. Let's see how this will end up in the following blog post.
